Code for the paper MarnKooy2022 "Marn N, Kooijman SALM (2022). The comparative energetics of the turtles and crocodiles. Ecology and Evolution 12(6): e8996; doi: 10.1002/ece3.8996."

To generate Figures 1-5 and Figure 7 of the main article, and Figures A1-A3 of the Appendix, run the following Matlab file: MarnKooy2022_fig.m
(run function without input to generate all possible figures, or select a (sub)plot of interest and run with a corresponding input; figures can be saved as .png or this step can be skipped by commenting corresponding lines of the code)

To generate Figure 6 of the main article, run the Matlab file: MarnKooy2022_mds.m
(figures can be saved as .png or this step can be skipped by commenting corresponding lines of the code)

MarnKooy2020_SI_Tables.pdf and MarnKooy2020_SI_Tables.tex Supplementary material that give the list of species (Table A.1) with the data types (Table A.2) that are used in the analysis and references.

Remarks: 
The figures show current AmP data, which might change in time; the results might differ from the publication
